Program Purpose: The purpose of this program is to convert a set of integers to octal values, then to ASCII, in order to decipher the hidden message. The second function of this program is to take an upper and lower bound and a step size, and then return the mean, median, and range of the alues. 

Inputs: upper_bound, lower_bound, step_size. ( i conerted the numbers to a list since there's so many characters).


Expected Output: Should return the deciphered message, the mean, median, and range.

Types of execution:

Repeated execution: For and while loops to repeat parts of the program if desired.
Sequential execution: User-defined functions are to execute from top to bottom.
Conditional execution: If else and while loops to determine if the program re-executes. 
Reusable: User-defined functions may be reused inside or outside of the program. 

Possible Improvements:
- The decyphered message isn't correct. I'm not sure if its becuase the negative numbers are being handled improperly, or what's going on there. A for effort
- Code is a little unorganized and comments are a little excessive.
- Could probably add better execptions handling.
